# ðŸ“‘ Project Brief: Social Event Coordination Web App (Revâ€¯2â€¯â€“â€¯30â€¯Mayâ€¯2025)

Telegram bot for planning outings with friends.

## 1â€¯â€”â€¯Purpose & Business Value

Build a lightweight web service that lets people **share upcoming-event plans**, **add friends**, and **discover & join friendsâ€™ plans**.
**Why it matters:** 65â€¯% of Genâ€¯Z coordinate outings via adâ€‘hoc chat threads (Statistaâ€¯2024). Centralising this flow boosts engagement for venues and users alike.

- `BOT_TOKEN` â€” Telegram bot token (required)
- `DB_URL` â€” SQLAlchemy database URL (optional, defaults to `sqlite:///db.sqlite3`)
